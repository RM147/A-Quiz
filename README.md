# A-Quiz

This project initially started during a particularly slow afternoon. Myself and a few colleagues ended up on Sporcle, to see how many Pokemon we could name. We ended up stopping because we got some pretty strong hints to do something more productive, but one of those hints was could we make our own?

This is my attempt to make a quiz site. It won't be taking on Sporcle anytime soon. It was intended to be a general quiz site, with questions you could load in, but it's currently pretty Pokemon themed. Maybe when I have time to type out long banks of questions and answers, raher than doing some actual coding...

To get it to work on your machine:

1. Get node and npm
2. Clone repository
3. npm update
4. npm install
5. go to localhost:3000 and enjoy!

Note: An issue I've encountered when trying to set up the site on a GCP VM is npm start doesn't work due to a missing module. 
If for whatever reason you're trying to do the same, my solution is 'npm install --save {missing_module}' and try npm start again.

Anyway, here is the Pokemon Quiz Site!
